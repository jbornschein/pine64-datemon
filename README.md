A small tool to monitor the system date and initiate a reboot if it jumps too far ahead. This is a workaround
for problems on some ARM SOC, in particular for Pine64 borads which apperantly have problems properly 
counting seconds

See, e.g. https://forum.armbian.com/topic/7423-pine64-massive-datetime-clock-problem/
